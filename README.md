# recolic/http-kv

This is a low-performance, slow, unsafe, un-scalable database with only get/set function.

However, it's easy to use and easy to deploy for naive usage. For example, use it in your homework!

## Update:

This naive script is ONLY designed for recolic's gitlab project auto-testing report.

See README.md in `https://git.recolic.net/root/cs164_lab2` for usage! (First image uses this tool to fetch latest testing result)
